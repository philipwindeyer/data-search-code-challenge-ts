# data-search (AKA data-search-code-challenge-ts)

A small command-line app written in TypeScript, to search structured data provided in JSON files (as part of a code challenge).  
The aim of this code base is to satisfy the requirements of a code challenge.

The code challenge solution in question has also been written in Ruby [here](https://github.com/philipwindeyer/data-search-code-challenge), although the Ruby version differs significantly and is generic in nature (in that it can be used to search any data set).

It specifically provides the ability to search for "organisations", "users" and "tickets" (provided via JSON files), and will display accompanying related data.
