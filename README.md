# data-search-code-challenge-ts

A small command-line app written in TypeScript, to search structured data provided in JSON files (as part of a code challenge).  
The aim of this code base is to satisfy the requirements of a code challenge.

The code challenge solution in question has also been written in Ruby [here](https://github.com/philipwindeyer/data-search-code-challenge) (although this version differs significantly and is generic in nature).

It specifically provides the ability to search for "organisations", "users" and "tickets" (provided via JSON files), and will display accompanying related data.
